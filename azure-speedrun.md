Using [Azure Container Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/) and Azure Developer CLI is a fast and easy way to deploy your Python web application.

Try for yourself and with just a few commands, create a containerized Django application and deploy it to the Azure.

This challenge walks you through deploying a containerized Django Architecture with PostgreSQL, and secured secret management via Key Vault using Azure Developer CLI.
